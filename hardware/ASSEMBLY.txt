How to build it
---------------

This is a collection of notes about how I build this thing, not necesarily the best way.

General steps
-------------

Before starting: 

* Make sure the board isn't coated in cack.
* Inspect the PCB for obvious faults. With a meter, check the VBAT and GND aren't shorted.
* Write serial number in the small area on the back bottom right corner.

Putting down SMD parts - 

* Put down only 1-3 parts at once, usually the same kind of part e.g. resistors, caps,
* Put down only parts in the same orientation at once - this saves spinning the board
    around constantly.
* Avoid losing SMD resistors by leaving them in the packet until needed :)
* Put some flux pen on the pads on the board
* Check for shorts after installing decoupling caps, in case they are internally shorted.


General precautions
-------

Checking for a short circuit earlier is better than later - it makes it easier to find the
short (fewer components to check) and avoids fire&smoke.

A lipo has easily enough current to set things on fire if they have a short (capacitors especially)
and it might also toast the PCB, writing off the whole thing.


BACK SIDE
-----

If using a SMD oven, it might be a good idea to do the back side first. The 1206 decoupling caps
are particularly tricky, there is a lot of copper around them.

If using an oven, place all the caps and motor drivers and put it in the oven.

After baking, visually check, and check for power short circuit, in case the oven broke the
caps and made them fail short.

After confirming no short circuit, measure the capacitance (if a capacitance meter is available)
to check that the caps are actually in-circuit and haven't failed open.

FRONT SIDE
-------

1. Place the regulator and front decoupling caps C2 and C6

1. Check for short circuit on VBAT-GND

1. Connect VBAT to bench supply with reasonable current limit; measure and check 5v is in tolerance.

1. Place the other front-side parts: MCU, resistors, LEDs.

1. Connect VBAT again to the bench supply, and check that the LEDs come on dimly.

At this point it may be possible to flash the firmware and check that the led pattern is
as expected, even if back is not yet populated. NB: C1 is not critical for testing the mcu works.

AFTER ASSEMBLY
---

DEFINITELY run on bench supply first before connecting a lipo. Set the bench supply to e.g. 1A max

Measure the 5v as soon as possible, if it's faulty then the MCU can be destroyed.

Flash the firmware through UPDI pin (need to ensure GND is connected to programmer too)
