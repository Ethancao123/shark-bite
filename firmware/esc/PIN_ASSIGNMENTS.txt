Pin assignments / usage

PA0 - RESET / UPDI - default - not used by code. Used for programming
	firmware, wired to a pogo pin on underside.
PA1 - UART0 TxD - used for diagnostic serial output.
	connected to pin 3 of the pogo pins J6 on underside of board.

PA2 - UART0 RxD - connected to the RXIN connection.
	This is used to receive either PPM signals, or serial
	from the radio.

PA3 - Motor1F (Weapon)
PA4 - Motor3R (Right)
PA5 - Motor3F (Right)

PA6 - BLINKY - high for blue LED, low for red LED.
PA7 - VSENSE - senses battery voltage.
	This is connected to two resistors pulled down by 10k, pulled up by 33k.
	So it will give the voltage of approximately VBAT * (10 / 43)
	Or approx 1/4 of the bat voltage.

PB0 - Motor1R (Weapon)
PB1 - Motor2R (Left)
PB2 - Motor2F (Left)

PB3 - Unused

Peripheral usage

USART0 - transmitter - for debug messages
	receiver - to receive digial data from rx

TCA0 - timer generates 6x PWM pulses on motors
	use in "split mode"

TCB0 - Count the pulse width on PA2 for pulse input
	could generate irq when pulse ends
TCB1 - Generate periodic interrupts
	- so that we can increment a time counter
	to run periodic tasks every so often

TCD0 - unused

EVENTSYSTEM - need to route event from pin PA2 to
	the TCB0 to sense pulses.

ADC - need just one channel to read bat. voltage
